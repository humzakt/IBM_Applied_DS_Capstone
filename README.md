# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

Capstone project for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera. The project predicts SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing success using end-to-end data science methodology — from data collection to machine learning classification.

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Data Collection API** | Gathered SpaceX launch data via the SpaceX REST API |
| **Data Collection with Web Scraping** | Scraped additional launch records from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup |
| **Data Wrangling** | Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handled missing values, created training labels |
| **EDA with SQL** | Exploratory analysis using SQL queries on the launch dataset |
| **EDA with Visualization** | Visual exploration with Matplotlib and Seaborn — trends, success rates, site analysis |
| **Machine Learning Prediction** | Built and compared classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) to predict landing outcomes |

## Tech Stack

- **Python** — Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **SQL** — Exploratory data analysis
- **BeautifulSoup** — Web scraping
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Interactive development
- **Folium** — Geospatial visualization

## Key Results

- Compared 4 classification algorithms for landing prediction
- Identified key features influencing landing success (payload mass, orbit type, launch site)
- Achieved best performance with tuned hyperparameters via GridSearchCV

## Certification

This project is part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) — a 10-course program covering data science methodology, Python, SQL, machine learning, and applied capstone projects.
